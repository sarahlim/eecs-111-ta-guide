# Professional Conduct

As a TA, you are an employee and representative of the EECS Department. You probably have friends taking the course (perhaps they have even signed up for your tutorials). **Remember that while you are acting as a TA, you are their TA first and friend second.**

## Obvious Don'ts

- Do not **give people solutions to assignments**.
- Do not **leak information about exam content or grades**.
- Do not **discuss other students' performance** with your friends.

## Less Obvious Don'ts

- Do not **discuss students on Slack *in any way***, positive or negative or neutral. This is a FERPA violation.
- Do not **loudly discuss anything department-related during quiz grading**. The conference room walls are not soundproof. Everyone can hear you. This extends to funny quiz answers, which we all laugh at despite our better judgment; keep it quiet.
- Do not feel obligated to **help students outside of your designated work hours**. This is an unfair burden on you, and creates inequal access, particularly if these students are your friends.
- Do not **feel bad** if someone asks a question and you don't know the answer (unless it was about a tutorial or assignment you didn't do beforehand, then you should feel bad). Tell the student you'll get back to them and Slack the group, ask another TA, or Google harder. Follow up with the student on Piazza with better information. Nobody knows everything.
- Do not **try to handle grading inquiries** (with the exception of [tutorial](./Tutorials.html#grading)-related concerns). Direct students to Sara or Curtis.
