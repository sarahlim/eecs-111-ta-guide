# Tutorials

In addition to Ian's lectures, all EECS 111 students must attend a weekly tutorial, hosted jointly by 2-4 TAs.

Tutorials usually cover the material from class the week of, or before.

In the past, tutorial sessions were spent entirely working on worksheets in small groups, led by a TA. For this quarter, general consensus so far is that we should begin each tutorial with a short lecture, followed by a short worksheet. This will depend on resources (i.e. schedule availability of TAs who feel comfortable lecturing). *We would like your input on this!*

**It is your responsibility to work through and understand the tutorial each week before hosting any of your sessions. Do not try to "wing it, lol."**

## <a name="grading"></a> Grading

TAs will assign students a **binary grade** based on attendance and attentiveness. **If it's obvious a student is on Facebook, Twitter, or just generally not paying attention, they get a 0**.

You are responsible for entering grades for your tutorial students directly in the Piazza gradebook.

Students will have **one tutorial grade dropped**, effectively providing a "grace period" for absences and conflicts. The official policy is that **students cannot make up tutorials by attending another session**, as this leads to accountability hell, but in the past we have left individual cases to individual TAs' discretion.

Tutorials accounted for 15% of the quarter's grade in Fall 2015.
