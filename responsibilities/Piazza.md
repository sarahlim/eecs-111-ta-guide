# Piazza

As you probably already know, Piazza is a forum for students to ask questions of the professor, TAs, and their classmates anonymously. 

As a TA, you should make a reasonable effort respond to Piazza questions. We understand that at times you aren't going to be available (or capable, if it's a weekend ðŸ˜‰) of answering Piazza questions. That being said, we certainly hope to see every TA's name in the forums at some point or another, even if it's just endorsing a good student answer.

In general, if you don't know how to answer a question, searching Piazzas from past iterations of the course can be very helpful.

## Formatting

Piazza supports rich-text formatting and a LaTeX-based equation editor. Use these to format your answers, particularly longer ones. At the lowest level of effort, **format your code blocks as such**.

To reference another thread in your answer:

1. Find the question in the sidebar, and hover over it to trigger the dropdown containing its reference number ("Type @571 to link to this post").
2. Include the reference in an answer by typing the at-symbol `@`, followed by the reference number.

This creates a link to the other thread. It's especially helpful for duplicate questions.
