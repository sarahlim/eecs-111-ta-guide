# Overview of Responsibilities

As TAs, your primary responsibilities are:

- Leading weekly **tutorials** of 5-7 students, and
- Holding weekly **office hours**.

In addition, we ask that you help by:

- Attending the weekly **staff meeting**,
- Proctoring and grading the three quarterly **quizzes**,
- Answering questions on **Piazza**.

Your position is paid for **6 hours per week**, so the total (outside of quiz grading and proctoring) time spent should land around there.

Part of being a good TA is knowing your content inside and out. To paraphrase the airline safety presentation,

> Please ~~place the oxygen mask~~ **know the content** first and then assist ~~your child or other passengers~~ **students**.

More specifically, quoth Ian:

> You are welcome to attend lectures, but shouldn’t feel obligated to do so.  You are, however, obligated to keep up with the lecture slides and assignments.  To avoid embarrassment, you should schedule time before office hours or tutorials to catch up on lecture slides and assignments.
 
It's always good to brush up on rusty concepts, especially if you took the course more than one quarter ago, along with concepts that [weren't in the version of EECS 111 you took](../Differences.html).

At a bare minimum,

- **Before each tutorial, you should have worked through the tutorial and understood it completely, and**
- **Before your office hours, you should have worked through the homework assignment for that week, and understood it completely.**

Feel free to ask questions on Slack if you have any!

## Tutorials

See the [full article on tutorials](./Tutorials.html).

## Office Hours

See the [full article on office hours](./OfficeHours.html).

## Staff Meeting

By default, the staff meeting will be **Thursdays at 5pm in Tech L324**.

It’s inevitable that some people will be unable to make it.  If you can’t make it, then you should **sign up for an extra hour of office hours or tutorials**.

## Quizzes

There will be **three quizzes**, the last of which we be held during the final exam slot.

We will have a grading pizza party for each quiz. **Grading typically lasts about 3 hours**, sometimes as little as 2.

To make sure it runs as smoothly as possible, we will also ask you to **sanity check the quiz before we hand it out**. That means we all get together and take the quiz during the staff meeting prior. Nobody will see your answers.

Your goal in taking the quiz is actively to be confused by it so we can **find all the bugs, ambiguities, and partial credit nightmares in advance**, thus allowing everybody, both students and staff, to have a much less painful experience.
