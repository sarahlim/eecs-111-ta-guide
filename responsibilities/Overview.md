# Overview of Responsibilities

As TAs, your primary responsibilities are:

- Leading weekly **tutorials** of 6 students, and
- Holding weekly **mentor hours**.

In addition, we ask that you help by:

- Proctoring and grading the two quarterly **quizzes**,
- Answering questions on **Piazza**.

Your position is paid for **6 hours per week**, so the total (outside of quiz grading and proctoring) time spent should land around there.

## <a name="preparation"></a> Preparation

Part of being a good TA is knowing your content inside and out. To paraphrase the airline safety presentation,

> Please ~~place the oxygen mask~~ **know the content** first and then assist ~~your child or other passengers~~ **students**.

More specifically, quoth Ian:

> You are welcome to attend lectures, but shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to do so.  You are, however, obligated to keep up with the lecture slides and assignments.  To avoid embarrassment, you should schedule time before office hours or tutorials to catch up on lecture slides and assignments.
 
It's always good to brush up on rusty concepts, especially if you took the course more than one quarter ago, along with concepts that [weren't in the version of EECS 111 you took](../Differences.html).

At a bare minimum,

- **Before each tutorial, you should have worked through the tutorial and understood it completely, and**
- **Before your mentor hours, you should have worked through the homework assignment for that week, and understood it completely.**

Feel free to ask questions on Slack if you have any!

## Correspondence

If you were a peer mentor in the past, you may be used to weekly staff meetings. This quarter (W2017), we have decided to eliminate these meetings in favor of a digest email that Sara sends out each week. 

## Quizzes

There will be **two quizzes**, the last of which we be held during the final exam slot.

We will have a grading pizza party for each quiz. **Grading typically lasts about 3 hours**, sometimes as little as 2.
