# Office Hours

We expect each TA to host **at least two office hours per week**.

## Scheduling

At the beginning of each quarter, we send out a Google Sheet so that everyone can coordinate office hours. **Please try to spread your hours out** as best as possible so that we may accommodate as many students as possible! 

Since we have roughly one zillion TAs staffing Fall 2016, time overlaps are inevitable. **We encourage overlapping TAs to hold pooled office hours.** Pooling is especially helpful for newer TAs, particularly when hours get busy or questions get hard.

## Rescheduling

If you need to reschedule your office hours (for the week or permanently), we ask that you make an announcement **at least 24 hours prior to your original hours** so that students are well aware and are able to adjust their schedules.

If something comes up and you are unable to reschedule/provide proper warning, **post a message to Slack with `@channel`** and try to arrange a swap or substitute.

If you organize a swap or substitute, it's good practice to **notify your students in advance** via Piazza message or email.

**The bottom line here is that we don't want students to show up to TA-less office hours**! :)
