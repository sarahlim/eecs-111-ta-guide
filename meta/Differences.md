# Differences Between Course Versions

You may have taken a different version of the course than you are currently TAing. If so, here is a brief summary of the differences between past course iterations.

## With Sara Sood, pre-2015

- Uses HtDP2e as the course text
- No imperative programming
- Greater emphasis on recursion, including the different types (as defined by the HtDP authors)
- Assignments are mostly sets of smaller, disparate problems
- No tutorials

## With Sara Sood, 2015-2016

- Uses HtDP2e as the course text
- Introduces imperative programming, using the filesystem pset
- Still strong emphasis on recursion types
- Assignments (other than the filesystem pset) are mostly sets of smaller, disparate problems
- Microquizzes and homework time during tutorials 

## With Ian Horswill, 2015 and later

- **Does not** use a course text; uses slides instead
- `lambda` introduced before `define`
- Less emphasis on recursion; no discussion of the HtDP distinctions
- No HtDP design recipe
- Stronger emphasis on imperative programming, object-oriented inheritance concepts
- Assignments tend to involve building up one larger program, with a greater emphasis on graphics and games, and thorough READMEs
- Tutorials have unique exercises

## With Sara Sood, 2017 and later

- Similar to Ian's course, with some minor distinctions
- **Does not** use a course text; uses slides instead
- `lambda` introduced before `define`
- Uses HtDP methodologies (- templates)
- Stronger emphasis on imperative programming, object-oriented inheritance concepts
- Assignments tend to involve building up one larger program, with a greater emphasis on graphics and games, and thorough READMEs
- Tutorials have unique exercises

If you're seeing something new, don't worry, but *do* take time to read up on unfamiliar concepts and go through the slides before running office hours or leading tutorials.
