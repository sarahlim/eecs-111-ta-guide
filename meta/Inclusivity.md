# Inclusivity

A lot of different people take EECS 111. These people fall into non-mutually-exclusive categories, such as:

- Students who excelled in AP Computer Science in high school,
- Students who have never written a line of code before,
- Students who have been programming on their own for years,
- Prospective computer science majors,
- Nonmajors fulfilling distribution requirements,
- Students "just trying to get a feel for" ~~big data and machine learning, the hot topics of tomorrow~~ computer science, wondering if it's right for them,
- and so on and so forth.

**As TAs, our job is to engage and teach *all* of these students.** EECS 111 can form lasting impressions of the program, or even the field as a whole. Be aware that many students may be coming from backgrounds different from yours, and strive to empathize whether they seem jaded, uncertain, or hopelessly confused.

Cynthia Lee, a lecturer in the Stanford University Department of Computer Science, has written an excellent article on the subject of inclusivity: ["What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLivou9-_wmsZuzKI2pCGQu0KHVIgYfJSaYhvTgO0Wo/edit) Although not all of these pointers may apply to your duties, it's good food for thought nonetheless.
