# JavaScript

New to Fall 2016, we are piloting a section on JavaScript. The intent of this experiment is twofold:

1. Give students a real-ish project to show off their FP skills, and
2. Placate the "Racket is stupid why can't I use a real language" chorus.

Shane and Slim are in charge of this section. We will be developing some sort of end-of-quarter homework/project written in JavaScript (ES6, specifically) for the students to work on. Other than that, we haven't worked out all of the details on this.

Before you freak out, some things to note:

- We won't be introducing JavaScript until later in the quarter. You will have advanced warning.
- We will hold a JavaScript workshop with all of the TAs before it is introduced to the students.

If you have ideas for an event-driven programming project, let us know. :D
