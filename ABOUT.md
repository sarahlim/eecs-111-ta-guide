This is an unofficial guide to being a TA for [EECS 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/111.html) at Northwestern University.

It is authored and maintained by the head teaching staff for Fall 2016, although contributions are highly encouraged. This manual is designed to be a living text, updated with explanations, advice, and "gotchas" as the quarter goes on.

When in doubt, check the [Racket Documentation](https://racket-lang.org), specifically the docs for:

- [Beginning Student](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html)
- [Beginning Student with List Abbreviations](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner-abbr.html)
- [Intermediate Student](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/intermediate.html)
- [Intermediate Student with Lambda](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/intermediate-lam.html)
- [Advanced Student](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/advanced.html)

If you have a suggestion or contribution, feel free to submit a pull request at our GitHub repo, or backchannel one of the head TAs.
