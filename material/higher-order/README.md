# Higher-order functions

Higher-order functions are an important aspect of the functional programming paradigm, because they provide abstractions for function composition and reuse.

Within the scope of EECS 111, higher-order functions allow students to think about computational problem-solving in terms of sequential transformations of data.

In EECS 111, we discuss about the following functions:

- [`map`](higher-order/map.md)
- [`filter`](higher-order/filter.md)
- [`foldl` and `foldr`](higher-order/foldl-foldr.md)
